# salon-agape-website
Website written for Salon Agape &amp; Co. All of this code is my own.

I am writing their website to better learn the process of web development, so that I can use these skills to make my own website better. Also, wordpress is kinda clunky so I wanted to write something more lightweight, and something that I have more creative control over. 

This project is currently: Being worked on
